# Caterpillar Tube Pricing competition

##Competition Details
Walking past a construction site, Caterpillar's signature bright yellow machinery is one of the first things you'll notice. Caterpillar sells an enormous variety of larger-than-life construction and mining equipment to companies across the globe. Each machine relies on a complex set of tubes (yes, tubes!) to keep the forklift lifting, the loader loading, and the bulldozer from dozing off. 

Like snowflakes, it's difficult to find two tubes in Caterpillar's diverse catalogue of machinery that are exactly alike. Tubes can vary across a number of dimensions, including base materials, number of bends, bend radius, bolt patterns, and end types.

Currently, Caterpillar relies on a variety of suppliers to manufacture these tube assemblies, each having their own unique pricing model. This competition provides detailed tube, component, and annual volume datasets, and challenges you to predict the price a supplier will quote for a given tube assembly.
